# ColorFilter


Color detection overlay tool.

**Note:** This is a quick script made to assist until Blue Marble adds this feature natively.
**This script takes a screenshot of the current screen and detects the pixels of the selected color. It has no direct interaction with the website, so itâ€™s something completely and 100% impossible to detect, even if the developers forbid such a function.**

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python ColorFilter.py
```

## Controls

- **X** - Toggle overlay visibility
- **E** - Select color with eyedropper
- **ESC** - Exit
